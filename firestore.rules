/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces public read and write access for 'contacts' and 'leads' collections.
 * User data is secured with owner-only access. Testimonials are publicly accessible for reading and writing.
 * Services can be read by anyone but only modified by authenticated users (admins).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /contacts/{contactId}: Contact form submissions.
 * - /leads/{leadId}: Service quote requests.
 * - /testimonials/{testimonialId}: Client testimonials.
 * - /users/{userId}: User account information.
 * - /services/{serviceId}: Service offerings.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Contact, Lead, and Testimonial submissions are publicly writable, meaning anyone can create, update, or delete them.
 * - User listing is disabled.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Not applicable in this scenario, as there are no ownership or role-based access control requirements other than user accounts.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Contacts, Leads, Testimonials, Users, and Services are stored in separate collections, simplifying rule management.
