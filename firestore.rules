/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces public write access for 'contacts' and 'leads' collections for anyone,
 * but read access is restricted to authenticated users (admins).
 * User data is secured with owner-only access. Testimonials are publicly readable.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /contacts/{contactId}: Contact form submissions.
 * - /leads/{leadId}: Service quote requests.
 * - /testimonials/{testimonialId}: Client testimonials.
 * - /users/{userId}: User account information.
 * - /services/{serviceId}: Service offerings.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Portfolio projects.
 * - /pricingPlans/{planId}: Pricing plans.
 * - /companyInfo/{infoId}: Company's contact information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Contact and Lead submissions are publicly writable.
 * - Reading contacts and leads is restricted to authenticated admins to protect PII.
 * - User listing is disabled.
